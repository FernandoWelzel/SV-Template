# Introduction

This is a template repository for ASIC and FPGA circuit design.

To standardize the workflow, all tools used are open. (NOT SURE I CAN DO IT - But should be a nice challenge)

## Usage

TODO: Include a description of Makefile methods.

## File system

TODO: Include a description of the file system including the directories created by the Makefile

## Prerequisites
